A python module implementing some generic MCMC routines.

The main purpose of this module is to serve as a simple MCMC framework for
Gaussian Process models developed in the GPy package.

Features:
    + Random walk proposals.
    + Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Dynamics (use the MALAProposal).
    + The MCMC chains are stored in fast HDF5 format using PyTables.

I have deliberately not adding any tuning capabilities in this library. This is
because tuning will be done (in the near future) using the Sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) component.
